# Welcome to Kubernetes!
Welcome to the Kubernetes workshop!
 This is the repository containing the basic walkthroughs and guides to the Kubernetes workshop conducted at the TAP Engineering Bootcamp 2024.

## Objectives
Through this mini-workshop, I hope that you will:
- Understand how Kubernetes fits into modern software development and deployment
- Have confidence in working deploying your own applications to Kubernetes

It is not realistic to expect the entirety of Kubernetes to be covered within a span of one hour, but I hope that through this workshop, you're at least able to obtain a high level understanding of Kubernetes concepts. Hopefully, you'll be able to use this workshop as a starting point to delve deeper into the many features and extensions that Kubernetes has to offer!

## Prerequisites and Setup
Before we get started, please make sure that you have the following software installed on your dev machine:
- Colima: https://github.com/abiosoft/colima (or Docker Desktop)
- Docker Engine: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
- Kubectl: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos/
- Kind: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/. Create a cluster with `kind create cluster`.
- Create an account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
