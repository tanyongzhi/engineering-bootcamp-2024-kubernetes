To ensure that you're well-prepared to attend the course, please complete this short pre-course homework!

Write an Express server in Node.js that listens on `port 8080` and:
- Echoes “TAP Engineering Bootcamp 2024!” as a response to all GET request with the root URL (`/`)
- Echoes the hostname (`os.hostname()`) as a response to all GET request with the path (`/hostname`)
- Echoes the hostname, and then exits/crashes as a response to the GET request with the path (`/crash`)
- Logs the port number that it is listening on when it first starts up.
